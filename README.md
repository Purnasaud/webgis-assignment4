# WebGIS Assignment 4 â€“ Leaflet + Open Data

This repository contains three productionâ€‘ready web maps built with **Leaflet**:

- **Weather Map:** Live NEXRAD radar (WMS) + active **NWS Alerts** styled by severity.  
  ðŸ‘‰ `weather/index.html`  
- **Earthquakes Map:** USGS allâ€‘day GeoJSON feed with magnitudeâ€‘scaled circle markers, popups and legend.  
  ðŸ‘‰ `earthquakes/index.html`  
- **Bonus â€“ Unified Hazard Map:** A single map with a **toggle control** to switch between Weather Alerts and Earthquakes (plus optional Radar).  
  ðŸ‘‰ `bonus-combined/index.html`

4. In your README, link to the pages using relative URLs:  
   - Weather: `./weather/index.html`  
   - Earthquakes: `./earthquakes/index.html`

## Notes
- Basemaps from **CARTO** (Positron/DarkMatter) were chosen to maximize contrast for radar & alert polygons.  
- Alerts are fetched from the official NWS endpoint `https://api.weather.gov/alerts/active`.  
- Earthquakes are fetched from **USGS** `https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_day.geojson`.  
- All maps include legends, layer controls, scale bars, accessible popups, and a glassâ€‘morphism UI for clarity.
